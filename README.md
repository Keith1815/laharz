# LaharZ

LaharZ is an open source tool which can be used to model various flow hazards, most significantly lahars. Its inputs are a digital elevation model (DEM), a stream file (which defines stream thalwegs) and a flow direction file. From these inputs, LaharZ creates an energy cone based on a height/length (H/L) ration; a set of initiation points (which can be edited) and a set of flow files based on a range of volumes.

The stream and flow files can be created on any appropriate QIS system; the resulting flows can similarly be displayed on any GIS system. However, LaharZ has been written and tested using QGIS.

The graphics produced can be displayed on any visualisation tool (including QGISâ€™s 3D mapping tool). However, LaharZ has been written and tested using Paraview for 3D graphics.

The programme is based on Schilling, S.P., 1998.
